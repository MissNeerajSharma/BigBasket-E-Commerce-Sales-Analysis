### üìä **Overview**
Welcome to my data analysis project on **BigBasket**, India's leading online grocery store. This project leverages Python to analyze the vast operational data of BigBasket, uncovering valuable insights into its inventory, pricing, and customer preferences.

BigBasket has grown to become a household name, delivering daily essentials efficiently across major cities in India. The objective of this project is to dive deep into their data, revealing trends that could further optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction.

Introduction
In today's fast-paced e-commerce industry, data-driven decision-making is the key to staying competitive. As part of our recent project on BigBasket's product dataset, we conducted an in-depth analysis to extract valuable insights, identify problem areas, and optimize strategies for better sales and customer experience.

Problem Statement
BigBasket, like many large e-commerce platforms, faces challenges in managing vast product catalogs, ensuring optimal pricing, and identifying the right inventory mix. Key challenges include:

Identifying Best-Selling and Least-Selling Products: Understanding product demand and optimizing stock levels.
Pricing and Discounting Strategies: Ensuring competitive pricing while maximizing profitability.
Data Quality Issues: Handling missing values and outliers affecting analytical accuracy.
Customer Preferences: Recognizing the top-rated and lowest-rated products to enhance offerings.

### üìÅ **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used for this analysis includes key attributes such as:
- `Product`: The name of the product.
- `Category`: The category the product belongs to (e.g., Beauty & Hygiene, Kitchen, etc.).
- `Sub-category`: The specific sub-group of products (e.g., Hair Care, Accessories).
- `Brand`: The brand name of the product.
- `Sale Price`: The current selling price of the product.
- `Market Price`: The listed price in the market.
- `Rating`: The customer satisfaction rating for the product.
- `Description`: Additional details about the product.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Libraries Used**
This project is powered by a combination of Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries:
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing data trends.
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations to enhance user engagement.

Our Solution Approach
To address these challenges, we conducted a step-by-step analysis:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Loaded and examined the dataset to identify inconsistencies.
Managed missing values in product descriptions, brands, and pricing.
Detected and handled outliers to ensure a robust analysis.
2. Identifying Best & Least Selling Products
Found that Turmeric Powder/Arisina Pudi was the top-selling product, while Green Tea - Pure Original was among the least sold.
Recommended targeted marketing campaigns for high-selling products and reassessment of slow-moving inventory.
3. Discount & Pricing Strategy Optimization
Analyzed discounts across products to determine effective pricing strategies.
Recommended adjusting discount rates based on competitive benchmarking.
4. Customer Ratings Analysis
Identified top-rated products, such as Face Wash - Oil Control and Smooth Skin Oil.
Highlighted the lowest-rated products, such as Water Bottle - Orange, suggesting potential product improvements or removals.
5. Visualization & Insights
Created bar plots and histograms to display product distribution across categories.
Determined that Beauty & Hygiene had the highest number of products, followed by Gourmet & World Food.
Recommended focusing on underperforming categories like Baby Care and Beverages to expand customer reach.
